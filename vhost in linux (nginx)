For vhost in linux:

(In Terminal)

use subl for Sublime Text and vim for vim editor


Step 1: sudo subl /etc/hosts
		
		#Enter address for the localhost site and then site name
		#Example: 127.0.0.*		example.lan		(you can use any no. in the place of *, I'm using lan for local)
		#Note: Each site should have an unique address

Step 2: sudo /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.lan.conf

		#In this you have to provide path for the site
		/*
		server {
			listen 80;
			listen [::]:80;

			root /var/www/html/example;			//path of site folder
			index index.php index.html index.htm;

			# Make site accessible from http://localhost/
			server_name example.lan;

			//log folder is important for nginx

			access_log  /var/www/html/example/log/access.log;		
	        error_log  /var/www/html/example/log/error.log;

			 location ~ \.php$ {
		                try_files $uri /index.php =404;
		                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock;		//here you have to define the php version
		                fastcgi_index index.php;
		                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		                include fastcgi_params;
		        }
		}
		*/

Step 3:	sudo ln /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.lan.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.lan.conf
		
		#you have to write example.lan.conf after sites-enabled it can't get by tab button

Step 4: sudo mkdir /var/www/html/example/log

		#/var/www/html/example/ = path of your site folder

Step 5:	sudo chmod -R 777 your site folder path
		
		#To give permission to server. so that it can read you folder's file

Step 6: service nginx restart

		# restart you nginx server so that you can browse your file on browser
		# if you are using apache server than you can use 
		# sudo service apache2 restart 		//this command

Step 7: open your browser and type your site name

		# ex. example.lan/
